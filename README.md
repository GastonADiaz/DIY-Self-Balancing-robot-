## Mechanical Design

In this section, I will describe the mechanical design of the robot, including the 3D printed parts and the overall assembly. The designs were created using SolidWorks 2021, which allowed me to visualize the dimensions needed and plan the hardware required, such as screws and other components. The toolbox in SolidWorks also helped in determining the quantity of parts needed and in assembling the pieces to see how everything fits together.

### 3D Printed Parts

- **Base plate of the structure**

  </p>  
  This part is designed to be the base of the balancing robot. It connects with the stepper motors and features 6 holes on each side for screws to secure the NEMA 17 motor mounts. Additionally, there are 4 holes for the 8mm threaded rod that supports the structure.

- **Support for the nema 17 stepper motors**  
  <p align="center">

  </p>  
  This piece functions similarly to metal brackets for NEMA 17 motors. However, by printing it, we reduce costs while maintaining the same efficiency for our project. It also includes 2 extra holes compared to standard brackets, allowing for more secure mounting with up to 6 screws.

- **Central plate of the structure**  
  <p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/329a52f9-5e00-43ab-9c70-090f463529dc" alt="Image 3" width="300" />
  </p>  
  This part includes 4 holes for the 8mm threaded rod and 4 additional holes to mount the electronic board. It serves as a key component in securing the electronics in place.

- **Upper plate of the structure**  
  <p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ee3df82-ac13-4035-ba25-cf51f8f19bed" alt="Image 4" width="300" />
  </p>  
  This piece is designed to be the top of the robot‚Äôs structure. It has 4 holes for the 8mm threaded rod and is a simple yet essential part of the assembly, providing the top support for the robot.

- **Wheels**  
  <p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/faa2bd36-064a-4dc6-b487-238db89fe1aa" alt="Image 5" width="300" />
  </p>  
  These are the wheel designs used for the robot. Initially, another type of wheel was planned (visible in the SolidWorks files), but this design was chosen for better performance and suitability for the project.

- **Assembly of the balancing robot**

  </p>  
  This image shows the overall assembly created in SolidWorks. It combines all the 3D printed parts, demonstrating how they fit together and providing a complete view of the robot's mechanical structure.

# Electronics

## Overview

In this section, I will describe the electronics used in the project. I utilized Wokwi to present the schematic in a more legible and understandable format for anyone. Proteus was primarily used to visualize the PCB design and its 3D model, which helped in understanding how the soldering would look and in planning the components layout.

## Circuit Diagram

I used Wokwi to create a clear and easy-to-understand schematic diagram. Below is the schematic created using Wokwi:

## Wiring Details

The following details explain the purpose of each color used in the wiring connections:

- üî¥ **Red**: Represents 3.3V output pin from the ESP32S.
- ‚ö´ **Black**: Represents GND.
- üîµ **Blue**: Represents the microstep pins (MS1, MS2, MS3) of the A4988 stepper motor drivers.
- üü¢ **Light Green**: Represents signals from the ESP32 to control motors steps and direction (STEP and DIR pins of the A4988).
- üå≤ **Dark Green**: Represents a bridge connection.
- üå´Ô∏è **Gray**: Represents the stepper motors coils 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B.
- üü¶ **Cyan**: Represents the I2C communication for the MPU6050.
- üü† **Orange**: Represents the power supply (9V, up to 35V).
- üå∏ **Magenta**: Represents 5V output from the 7805 voltage regulator.

## PCB Creation with Proteus

Proteus was used for creating the PCB and its 3D model. Due to the lack of some components in Proteus's default libraries, I had to create many components from scratch. This software allowed me to design the PCB layout and visualize it in 3D before finalizing the design. The red welding paths represent the top layer of the PCB, and the blue welding paths represent the bottom layer. Proteus also provided the dimensions of the PCB and the distances between centers, which were crucial for the final assembly.

Here are the images of the PCB design and its 3D model:

Proteus provides us with the PCB format in 3D, using the IGES format. This file can be visualized and used in SolidWorks.

  <img src="URL_DE_LA_IMAGEN_DEL_PCB_INFERIOR" alt="PCB Bottom Side" width="600"/>
  <br />
  <i>PCB Bottom Side</i>
</p>

To simplify the circuit, I used fewer wires by implementing solder paths between components on the bottom side of the PCB. On the top side, I utilized jumper wires to make connections more straightforward.
